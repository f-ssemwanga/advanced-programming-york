Once upon a midnight dreary, while Ipondered, weak and weary,Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore-While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenlythere came a tapping,As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door -'Tis some visitor,' I muttered, 'tapping at my chamber door -Only this and nothing more,'“Be that word our sign of parting, bird orfiend#” I shrieked, upstarting –“Get thee back into the tempest and theNight’s Plutonian shore#Leave no black plume as a token of thatLie thy soul hath spoken#Leave my loneliness unbroken# – quit the bust above my door#Take thy beak from my heart, and takethy form from off my door#”Quoth the raven ‘Nevermore.’Exert form Edger Allen Poe's "The Raven".
